# 🧩 Business Problem  
Banks and financial institutions often face the challenge of **customer churn**—when customers leave the service. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Hence, identifying the factors leading to churn is critical for improving customer loyalty and profitability.

## 🎯 Objective  
- Understand the factors influencing customer churn  
- Segment customers based on risk to enable proactive retention strategies  
- Identify patterns and profiles of customers who are most likely to leave  
- Help the business take data-driven decisions to improve customer retention

---

## 🔍 What I Did  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis** on a customer dataset  
- Calculated **overall churn rate** and analyzed churn by different demographics and behavior patterns  
- Created **risk segments** (low, medium, high) based on business logic  
- Focused on **actionable insights** to help reduce churn

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed  
- **Overall Churn Rate**: Found the percentage of customers who exited  
- **Churn by Geography**: Identified regions with higher churn risk  
- **Churn by Age Group**: Analyzed churn tendency among young, middle-aged, and senior customers  
- **Balance & Salary Comparison**: Compared financial metrics between churned and retained customers  
- **Tenure vs Churn**: Checked if loyalty (tenure) affects churn  
- **Product Usage vs Churn**: Assessed how number of products influences churn  
- **Credit Card Ownership & Activity Level**: Examined behavioral factors linked to churn  
- **Risk Segmentation**: Built customer profiles based on age, activity, credit score, and balance

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **SQL (MySQL)** – for data analysis and segmentation  
- **DBMS** – to run queries and create views for risk profiling  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Senior customers**, those with **low credit scores**, and **inactivity** show higher churn  
- Customers with **high balances** are valuable but may still churn if not engaged  
- **Inactive members**, especially older ones with poor credit, are at highest risk  
- **Geography** plays a role in churn, possibly due to regional service issues or competition

---

## ✅ Outcome  
This project highlights **churn patterns** and builds a foundation for **customer retention strategies**. The insights can help target **high-risk profiles** with personalized interventions like better engagement, loyalty rewards, or financial counseling.
