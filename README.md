# Bank Customer Churn Analysis - Risk Profiling & Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project uses a bank customer dataset to analyze customer churn and build a **Risk Profiling** and **Recommendation System**. The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving the bank and suggest personalized retention strategies based on their financial behavior, activity status, and credit score.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking industry. By analyzing customer data, we can identify factors leading to churn and develop strategies to retain high-risk customers.

## Objectives
- **Churn Analysis**: Identify factors contributing to churn.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Create risk profiles to categorize customers as high, medium, and low risk.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generate recommendations to reduce churn based on the risk profiles.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used to visualize customer churn, segmentation, and risk profiles.
- **GitHub**: Project and code repository.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured data integrity.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Calculated summary statistics and analyzed churn distribution across age, geography, and credit score.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features like customer tenure, activity status, and credit score grouping.

4. **Risk Profiling**
   - Categorized customers into high, medium, and low-risk groups based on their financial data and activity.

5. **Recommendation System**
   - Based on the risk profiles, generated tailored recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Current Progress
- Data cleaning and exploration are completed.
- Customer segmentation and risk profiling have been implemented.
- Recommendations based on risk levels are ready.

## Next Steps
- Enhance visualizations in Power BI.
- Further refine the risk profiling model
